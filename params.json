I created this project just to record the meeting result from scrum. Every morning, we set a scrum meeting and discuss about the project. And we define who have to work what. At this time, we can record these data. There is no authentication system, no validation process, and can only be used by scrum master. Just initialization idea, have to extend in the future. Thanks. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2011, Naing Linn Thet(@fokhwar) founded scrum project.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nYou can contact me by fokhwar@gmail.com","name":"Scrum"}
