{"tagline":"Record your scrum meeting result. Enjoy It!","body":"### Welcome to Scrum Project\r\nActually, this project is not complete enough. I created this project just to record the meeting result from scrum. Every morning, we set a scrum meeting and discuss about the project. And we define who have to work what. At this time, we can record these data. If you interest, you can get my project by the following command.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout .\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2011, Naing Linn Thet(@fokhwar) founded scrum project.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nI can be contacted by fokhwar@gmail.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
